# AES-encrypted-SMS-App-with-Image-segmented-password
The user can send an encrypted message and can also decrypt an encrypted message.
The user is using the contact number of the receiver to send an encrypted SMS.
The app uses AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) algorithm to encrypt and decrypt the messages.
The user has to go through a high level authentication process based on image segmentation.
<h2>Features</h2>
<ul>
<li>Encryption: The user can encrypt a message and send it to any user using its contact number.</li>
<li>Decryption: The user is allowed to view the original message using the highly secured message and the secret key.</li>
<li>Image Based password: User can select image and then create a password based on a selected sequence of image segments.</li>
<li>Fast and Easy, Highly reliable and secure</li>
<li>No internet connection required</li>
</ul>
